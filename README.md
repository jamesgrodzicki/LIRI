![prompt-screen](/images/prompt-screen.png)

### This is LIRI. It is a command line interface where the user can search for 3 different things. They can search for information about songs, upcoming concerts, or movies. Once the user selects what they would like to search for, they will be prompted again to enter their desired song/artist/movie. Then LIRI will request from the __spotify__ API, the __bandsintown__ API, or the __OMDB__ API and will print interesting information about the search to the console.
